# Example app for edge_to_edge_system_ui

This example demonstrates how to use the `edge_to_edge_system_ui` package to:

- Initialize the Kotlin plugin and query system information.
- Enable/disable edge-to-edge at runtime.
- Apply status and navigation bar colors (and let the package compute icon
  brightness automatically).
- Use `pushStyleForRoute` to apply a style that will be automatically
  restored when the route is popped.

## Quick start

1. In the example `main.dart` the plugin is initialized in `main()`.
2. The example `MaterialApp` registers the package `routeObserver` so per-route
   restoration works:

```dart
navigatorObservers: [routeObserver],
```

3. Run the example via `flutter run` in the `example/` directory.

## Files of interest
- `lib/main.dart` — app entry; shows initialization and the registered
  `routeObserver`.
- `lib/home_page.dart` — main UI showing presets, custom colors, and deep
  customization where status/navigation bar backgrounds are set.
- `lib/debug_info_page.dart` and `lib/debug_info_page2.dart` — demo pages
  that push styles for specific routes and demonstrate automatic
  restoration when navigating back.

## Notes
- The example imports the package using `package:edge_to_edge_system_ui/...`
  so it mirrors how external users would use the package.
- If you intend to publish the package, ensure `doc/getting_started.md` is
  present and `doc/api` is generated by `dartdoc` (do not check `doc/api`
  into source control).
